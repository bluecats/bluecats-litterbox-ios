###Here's the basics:

**Step 1:  Clone the repo into a directory of your choosing.**

**Step 2:  Prepare for pods.**

- If you have never used cocoapods:
 + Follow the install instructions from cocoapods.org
 + Upon completion of the install, navigate to your repo directory and run 'pod install'
 + For all subsequent updates to this app, run 'pod update' from your directory (do not run 'pod install' a second time)
        
        
- If you have used cocoapods before:
 + Navigate to your repo directory and run 'pod install'
 + For all subsequent updates to this app, run 'pod update' from your directory (do not run 'pod install' a second time)


**Step 3:  Get your app token from BC Reveal or [app.bluecats.com/apps](http://app.bluecats.com/apps)**


**Step 4:  The XCode simulator does not support BLE USB dongles so you must debug your app on an actual device with BLE support**
